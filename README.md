# Code Challenge
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the
two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the area is the biggest.
Return the maximum container area.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

**Output**: 49

Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case,
the max area of the container is 49.

### Example 2

**Input**: height = [1,1]

**Output**: 1
